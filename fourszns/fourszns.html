            <h1>The Seasons</h1>
            <p><img src="seasons.jpg" class="bgpic">There are typically four distinct climate periods we experience on Earth: Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter (unless you live in Montana, then there are only three). According to timeanddate.com, these seasons occur because the "Earth's axis is slightly tilted in relation to its orbit around the Sun". Click on the navigation bar above to learn more facts about each of the individual seasons!</p>
           
            
            <h2>The Four Seasons Make Music Too?</h2>
            <p><img src="fourseasons.jpeg" class="music">Did you hear the Four Seasons make music too? Well, not the literal seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter can't sing silly). But there is an American rock-n-roll group known as the "Four Seasons" that was pumping out iconic hits in the 1960s! Some of their best songs include Sherry, Big Girls Don't Cry, Walk Like A Man, and  Oh, What a Night. With a cast of Frankie Vallie, Tommy DeVito, Bobby Gaudio, and Nick Massi, the Four Seasons left an indelible mark on the music industry and are still beloved today!
