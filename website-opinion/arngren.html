            <p><img src="arngrenwebpage.jpg" class="jackson">I had to do some opinion-article searching to find this website, and I must say I do not like it at all. This website seems to be a store for a bunch of random hobby items and RC toys.At first glance it is way too crammed with text and images, leaving you searching for a place to start. It looks very rudimentary and even sketchy. Trying to differentiate clickable text links with one that do not link is a nightmare, and there seems to be very little organization. You can barely spot the title of the website, but you can definitely see that it is not secure! Right off the bat, the code is much less extensive than Apple’s and Google’s. It still has the standard HTML5 elements such as "body", "meta", "style", "script", and "div". I still could not spot any "table" code in the web inspector. The validation inspector tool from Moodle picked out a significant amount of errors and warnings, way more than the previous two sites. With about 1000 errors and 30 warnings, there seems to be a lot wrong with the site. The layout consists of one left-hand column section with clickable words leading to similarly categorized products. And the rest of the home page is a discombobulated mass of product images and text. The page scrolls, but it is not active. Navigation is terribly confusing to me, as the same clickable links appear multiple times all over the page, and there is not much organization. There’s about 30-40 clickable categories in the left column area, which makes things very convoluted. There is no color theme to this page at all. The text is a million different color with no clear correlation. There is a bit of white space, but it not used well at all and pales in comparison to Apple and Google. The product images used in this website are not uniform at all, with photos of differing resolutions, compositions, and crops. Not to mention there is an odd mix of GIFs and animations, along with still product photos. Overall, I am not sure if this website was meant to be a joke, but it sure looks like a website that would rank on the Top 10 worst websites ever.</p>
