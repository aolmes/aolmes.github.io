            <h1>Google</h1>
            <p><img src="googleproducts.jpg" class="jackson">Google is another very good website. Considering they are a competitor to Apple in many regards, their website does a great job of stacking up to it. However, it takes a different approach to the overall aesthetic of the page, along with navigation. Google’s code is also keeps itself at the forefront, using a multitude of HTML5 elements like "script", "iframe", "meta", and "style". Within the "style" elements, there is an overwhelming amount of code dealing with font-families, font-sizes, font-weights, etc. I also did not see any "table" coding in the Google website, but instead a ton of "link"’s, "meta"’s, "script"’s, and "iframe"’s. The website also validates. This website also makes sense in regards to the layout. It is a singular column that scrolls smoothly up and down, with a similar compartment style to Apple’s website. The navigation bar stays stagnant for the most part, until you scroll back to the top. At the top, it expands to more options and product promotion windows. The navigation is very good too, maybe a little better than Apple’s. When you click on the navigation buttons, a drop down window with more clickable options appears. This makes searching for specific products much easier. The website overall is not super colorful, as it utilizes a substantial amount of white space and grey accents. However, like Apple, they use color in the images of their products, which makes them stand out. The contrast of the white space and grey product backgrounds allows the products to stand out, much like Apple’s color-placement approach. Another aspect that helps Google standout is the use of animations in their product images. Apple used stagnant photos in their home page scroll, whereas Google used short product animations to spice it up. Products move in relation to one another in a satisfying way, which is another way to captivate customers.
