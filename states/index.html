<h1>Western States Websites</h1>
    

    <H3>1. California</H3>
    <p><img src="california-flag.png" width= 30%></p>
    <p>California has the best website hands down. It is easy to navigate and click on, using both computers and cell phones. It also has scrolling website that has multiple sections of information, including how to find state agencies, statistics, and news on the state. The colors and images used are very visually appealing, and the icons are good indicators. All the content fits evenly across the page, and extends to the margins of the website. </p>

    <H3>2. Oregon</H3>
    <p><img src="oregon-flag.png" width= 30%></p>
    <p>Oregon comes in at second on the list. They also have a scrolling webstite, which helps you easily navigate the sections of information. Initially there is a seach bar and the top services that users can search through. This increases the usability factor and makes searching simple. While the colors are not as flattering as California's site (lots of green), it is still all tied together with nice imagery, and color-matching padding and margins. The tabs and text are easy to click, and the site actively resizes when you minimize it.</p>

    <H3>3. Nevada</H3>
    <p><img src="nevada-state.svg" width= 30%></p>
    <p>Nevada falls in the middle of this list. Yes, it has a scrolling site that resizes as you shrink the window. It also has navigation tabs, and a nice running promotional video at the top of the page. However, it is not as clean as the previous two websites. The text on the site could be more appealing, and the two windows of news for the public meetings section and the twitter feed are not implemented very well (little bit of an eyesore). Despite those, they do a good job of using a lot of nice photographs for the sites background as you scroll.</p>

    <H3>4. Washington</H3>
    <p><img src="washington-flag.png" width= 30%></p>
    <p>Washington's website is pretty basic compared to the previous three sites. It is not a scrolling website, so you are stuck on the home page the whole time. From a utilitarian aspect, it has all the navigation and clickable text to direct you to various sections of information, which is presented in a straight-forward fashion. However, it lacks in the visuals department. It only has several images that appear when you hover over some tabs (they look like stock images). Also, the text and padding are pretty plain and do not make you say "wow" at all. Overall, this website seems to just serve its utilitarian purpose, and that's about it.</p>

    <H3>5. Arizona</H3>
    <p><img src="arizona-flag.svg" width= 30%></p>
    <p>Arizona lands in last place on this list (come on Arizona). It had potential to be a good website, but unfortunately does not do it as well as the others, even bland Washington. It has a website that resizes when you crop the browser window, which is nice. However, it does not scroll, well... not up and down. You can click arrows to scroll sideways through the pages (weird). Although it serves its purpose of getting you to the different sections of information, it is not the easiest way of navigating. I also can't help but feel that the site feels cramped and disproportionate (the navigation bar and AZ logo is relatives small, while there is a weird footer bar with photo information at the bottom that doesn't need to be there. Overall, I just felt confusted when I first looked at the website, and it does not feel very user-friendly.</p>
