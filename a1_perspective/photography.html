            <h3> Welcome to A1 Perspective </h3>
            <img src="profile.jpg" class="profile">

           <p> Hello, my name is Alex Olmes. I am a 21 year old amateur photographer from Benicia, California. I am working on my Business Marketing and Management degree from Carroll College in Helena, Montana. I first took interest in photography after watching my mom capture awesome snapshots of family vacations and scenery growing up. When I got my first smartphone (the Samsung Galaxy S5), I began capturing my own stills of my day-to-day life. </p>
           <p> Now that I didn't have to borrow my mom's camera, I started taking photos of everything from flowers, to sunsets, to mountains, you name it. After a while I decided it was time to step up my photography game, and I needed to invest in a DSLR camera. With money saved up from high school graduation, I bought a Nikon D5500. Every since then, I have been experimenting with new perspectives on quality moments and objects in life!</p>
