Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have a twin? Maybe you have always wanted a wombmate, a forever friend, or a constant source of confusion and hilarity. Well look no further than renting Anthony, a certified twin who acts and performs just like a real one!</p>

<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p>Anthony is like having any other friend. Toss him some snacks occassionally so he can continue to function. He really likes corn nuts, Talkis, watermelon sourpatch, and pizza. You will also need to fill him up with fuel. The preferred fuel grades would be Bang! Energy, Gogi Berry Mountain Dew, Arizona Sweet Tea, or San Pelligrino. After that you just need be mindful to give him some attention here and there; listen to him strum a guitar, laugh at his jokes, and get on his level in Super Smash. </p>

<h3>Rent Now</h3>
<p>I don't need him all the time now, so if you want to some laughter and companionship, smash the button below!</p>
